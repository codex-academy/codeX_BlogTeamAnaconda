<div class="text">
	<p>We think coding is cool. The perception of it within the general public is still outdated. We want to update the image of a stereotypical coder and inspire young people to start coding by developing more coding skills at Project code X by also working on the real projects as Mr Andre said. In fact we could say not everybody should become a coder, but we would like to inspire as many as possible to give it a go. We have dreams to build something out of nothing,more specially on developing to explore new ideas of managing businesses with technology devices included and our qualifications</p>
	<br>
	<p>We are here at project code X because there are still the elite authors and developers that write better than the rest of us but just because everyone can write, doesn't mean everyone is trying to be a professional author including online people with businesses, then we still want to go with that process of how to be a Professional developer & author. We also think as a blogger, it sometimes feels like coding would be a useful tool, as we sit in Cape Town garage(4th floor) in front of these machines attending code X all week days. Really in fact, we as a team that works on a computer we might find some utility in learning how they operate by committing ourselves to a friend named Internet by gathering any info, and the way it seems as if it's pretty addictive.</p>
